# ecdh - ElectroChemical Data Handling
edch provides easy solutions for simple handling of electrochemical data. Most emphasis is so far put on how to display the data using matplotlib.\

## Features:
- Galvanostatic Cycling
    - Plot Charge/Discharge curves over cycle life
        - Range, specific or all cycles can be plotted in addition to trimming of the first *x* cycles.
    - Plot Capacity retention over cycle life
    - Plot dQ/dV
    - Plot data from any number of input files
- Cyclic Voltammetry
    - Still in the works...


## Supported Input filetypes:
- Neware backup files (.xlsx)
- Neware export as general report (.csv)
- Biologic (.mpt)
- Batsmall (.dat)
